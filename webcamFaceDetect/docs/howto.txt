There are some concerns in order to this project run:

1)  The native library: it is stored in folder natives under this project main folder,
    the file name is libopencv_java300.so.
    It may not run but in linux, as: the native library was compiled under linux.
    The solution would be to replace it by a java native file from a opencv 3.0 compiled
    under windows.

2)  In order to detect faces, opencv uses cascade files.
    There are several of them under the folder src/res/classifiers.
    The choosen one must be refered on Processor.java, as:
        String CASCADEFILE = getClass().
                getResource("/res/classifiers/haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml").getPath();
    In windows this addressing usually does not works, so it must be changed to a windows
    string file path.

3)  This project demands a functional webcam attached to work properly.
